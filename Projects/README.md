# Project : Data Warehouse

## Introduction
A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

As their data engineer, i was tasked with building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights into what songs their users are listening to. 

## Project Description
In this project, i'll apply what i've learned on data warehouses and AWS to build an ETL pipeline for a database hosted on Redshift. To complete the project, i will need to load data from S3 to staging tables on Redshift and execute SQL statements that create the analytics tables from these staging tables.

## Datasets
* Song data: <code>s3://udacity-dend/song_data</code>
* Log data: <code>s3://udacity-dend/log_data</code>
* Log data json path: <code>s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json</code>

## Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.

<code>song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json</code></br>
<code>song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json</code>

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

<code>{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}</code>

## Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

The log files in the dataset i'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.
<code>log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json</code></br>
<code>log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json</code>

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

## Schema for Song Play Analysis
Defined data structure for DWH analysis:

### Fact Table
<code>songplays</code> - Records in event data associated with song plays i.e. records with page <code>NextSong</code></br>
<code>songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent</code>

### Dimension Tables
<code>users</code> - users in the app
<code>user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level</code>
<code>songs</code> - songs in music database
<code>song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration</code>
<code>artists</code> - artists in music database
<code>artist_id, name, location, lattitude, longitude</code>
<code>time</code> - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
<code>start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday</code>
