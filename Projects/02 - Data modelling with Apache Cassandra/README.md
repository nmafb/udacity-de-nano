# Project : Data Modelation with Apache Cassandra

The purpose of this database is to get information about Saprkify songs and their users activity on their streaming app.
The main reason is to find out what songs are being listened by the users.

## Datasets
For this project, you'll be working with one dataset: event_data. The directory of CSV files partitioned by date. Here are examples of filepaths to two files in the dataset:
event_data/2018-11-08-events.csv
event_data/2018-11-09-events.csv
