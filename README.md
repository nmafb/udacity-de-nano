### Data Modeling with Postgres - Sparkify
The purpose of this database is to get information about Saprkify songs and their users activity.
The main reason is to find out what songs are being listened by the users.

## How to Run Python scripts
With python installed, open a terminal with in the local folder of the file and execute:
<code>python3 create_tables.py</code>

## Files in the repository
* sql_queries.py   
  * All the scripts needed to Create/Drop the tables, Insert statements and query

* create_tables.py 
  * It Drops and creates the database Sparkify
  * Executes the file sql_queries

* etl.ipynb
  * Jupyter notebook with the full ETL process that transforms the data and fills all the tables
